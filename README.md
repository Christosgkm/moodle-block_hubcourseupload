# Hub Course Upload Block
*moodle-block_hubcourseupload*

The Hub Course Upload Block plugin is a part of a suite of three plugins designed to replace the core Moodle Hub code. Since Moodle 3.3, this Publish function inside courses has been removed and the previous MoodleNet Hub will be replaced by a new MoodleNet strategy that is under construction. Associations and organizations can use these three new contributed plugins to share courses without having to change Moodle core.

The purpose of this Hub Course Upload Block plugin is to create an alternative course upload and restore interface for Moodle Site to ease user uploading and submitting their courses to Moodle Site from their mbz course files. The block can work separately from the suite, which means it can be an instant upload and restore block using Moodle existing functions of course restoring, but its usage is more suitable for a Moodle hub site since the site administrator can choose whether to allow general site users to upload and restore courses to the site.

This plugin is a block type and displays on site home and user dashboard, it allows users to easily upload their mbz files and restore them from dashboard. It also works together with the hub course info block ([moodle-block_hubcourseinfo](https://github.com/ponlawat-w/moodle-block_hubcourseinfo)) by having plugin settings for triggering hub course info block instance creation in uploaded course via the block.

Information for this plugin is available from Don Hinkelman ([hinkelman(at)mac.com](mailto:hinkelman@mac.com)) and programming support is by Ponlawat Weerapanpisit ([ponlawat_w(at)cmu.ac.th](mailto:ponlawat_w@cmu.ac.th)).
